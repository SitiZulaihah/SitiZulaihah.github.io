For those of you who may have content written by multiple authors on your site you can now assign different authors to each post if desired.

Previously the theme used a global author for the entire site and those attributes would be used in all bylines, social networking links, Twitter Card attribution, and Google Authorship. These `owner` variables were defined in `config.yml`

Start by modifying or creating a new `authors.yml` file in the `_data` folder and add your authors using the following format.

{% highlight yaml %}
# Authors

Siti Zulaihah:
  name: Zully Zulaikha
  web: http://thewhip.com
  email: zullyzulaihah@gmail.com
  bio: "You Can Do it."
  avatar: bio-photo-2.jpg
  twitter: Zully_Laikha
  google:
    plus: Siti Zulaihah

To assign Siti Zulaihah as an author for our post. You'd add the following YAML front matter to a post:

{% highlight yaml %}
author: Zully Zulaikha
{% endhighlight %}
